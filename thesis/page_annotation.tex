This thesis addresses the educational gap between distributed systems theory and practical engineering by developing an educational framework for blockchain technology. It investigates the central question of whether a modular, visualization-integrated blockchain system can effectively bridge this gap by facilitating active learning. The primary contributions are twofold: first, the design and implementation of a modular, Python-based blockchain system that uses the PoS consensus algorithm and a real-time visualization explorer; and second, a 5-module educational laboratory curriculum. This integrated approach transforms the learning process from passive observation to active system architecture, enabling students to evaluate performance trade-offs and learn complex distributed ledger concepts through hands-on experimentation.
